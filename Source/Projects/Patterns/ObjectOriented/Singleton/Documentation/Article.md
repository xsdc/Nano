# Singleton

> Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

## Pattern overview

- The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a particular class is ever created.

- This can be leveraged to provide efficient resource management.

## Problem statement

- Across the Apple Store app, we would like access to a user's information for various purposes.

- These include greeting the user, displaying their details, or showing their profile picture.

- Our team has decided to avoid passing the user's information across the app.

- We can use the Singleton pattern to solve this problem.

- This allows us to conveniently access and update it.

## Definitions

#### Singleton:

- Responsbile for creating and managing the single instance of a class.

- The initializer is private to prevent external instantiation.

```swift
class User {
    static let shared = User()

    private init() {}

    var name: String = "Tim"

    var greeting: String {
        return "Hello, \(name)"
    }
}
```

## Example

```swift
let user = User.shared
print(user.greeting) // Hello, Tim
```

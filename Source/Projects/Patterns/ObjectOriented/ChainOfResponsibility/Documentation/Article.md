# Chain of Responsibility

> Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.

## Pattern overview

- The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a way of linking a series of actions.

- Each action has a task to perform, and once it's completed, the request is passed to the next action in the chain.

- This pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns and flexibility in the order of actions.

## Problem statement

- When users add a product to their bag, a series actions need to be performed.

- For example, checking if the product is in stock, attempting to add it to the bag, and logging an analytics event.

- Handling all of these actions in a single class is possible, but can lead to coupling and a lack of flexibility.

- The Chain of Responsibility pattern can be used to create a chain of handlers, each responsible for a specific action.

- Each handler performs its specific action and then passes the request to the next handler in the chain.

- This enabled a clear separation of concerns and allows for flexibility to add, remove, or reorder the handlers in the chain.

## Definitions

### Handler:

- Defines the interface for handling requests and setting up the chain.

- We're using a closure to communicate the result of the request.

- The `Request` object can be used at any point in the chain.

```swift
protocol Handler {
    var next: Handler? { get }

    func handle(request: Request, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void)
}

struct Request {
    let productId: String
}
```

### Concrete handlers:

- Handles requests it is responsible for.

- Maintains a reference to the next handler in the chain.

- In this chain, before adding the product to the bag, the stock check handler checks if the product is in stock.

- If it's in stock, then the add to bag handler is called.

- Assuming it gets added to the bag, the logging handler is called, completing the chain.

- This approach allows for flexibility in the order of the handlers while keeping a clear separation of concerns.

```swift
class StockCheckHandler: Handler {
    private(set) var next: Handler?

    init(next: Handler?) {
        self.next = next
    }

    func handle(request: Request, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        let isInStock = Bool.random()

        if isInStock {
            completion("Product \(request.productId) is in stock")
            next?.handle(request: request, completion: completion)
        } else {
            completion("Product \(request.productId) is out of stock")
        }
    }
}

class AddToBagHandler: Handler {
    private(set) var next: Handler?

    init(next: Handler?) {
        self.next = next
    }

    func handle(request: Request, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        let addToBagSucceeded = Bool.random()

        if addToBagSucceeded {
            completion("Product \(request.productId) added to bag")
            next?.handle(request: request, completion: completion)
        } else {
            completion("Failed to add product \(request.productId) to bag")
        }
    }
}

class LoggingHandler: Handler {
    private(set) var next: Handler?

    init(next: Handler?) {
        self.next = next
    }

    func handle(request: Request, completion: @escaping (String) -> Void) {
        completion("Analytics event logged for product \(request.productId)")
        completion("Request completed")
    }
}
```

## Example

```swift
let loggingHandler = LoggingHandler(next: nil)
let addToBagHandler = AddToBagHandler(next: loggingHandler)
let stockCheckHandler = StockCheckHandler(next: addToBagHandler)

let request = Request(productId: "1234")
stockCheckHandler.handle(request: request) { result in
    print(result)
}
```

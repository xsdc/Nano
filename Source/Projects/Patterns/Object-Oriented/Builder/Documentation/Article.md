# Builder

> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Pattern overview

- The Builder pattern is used to construct objects piece by piece.

- Each part of the object is configured via a method on a builder object.

- We are able to provide different representations of the object using the same construction process.

## Problem statement

The Apple Store has a feature called the Apple Watch Studio, which allows customers to choose the size, material, and band for their Apple Watch. There are different collections of Apple Watches, such as Series 10 and Hèrmes Series 10. In the future, collections may be added or removed, and new sizes, materials, and bands may be introduced.

No matter which collection and options are chosen, the API where we submit configured Apple Watches remains the same. We are faced with the challenges of constructing Apple Watches with various configurations and maintaining a consistent output. The Builder pattern gives us the needed flexibility in the construction process and allows us to conform to the requirements of the API.

## Definitions

#### Product

The object that is being constructed.

```swift
struct AppleWatch {
    var collection: String
    var size: String
    var material: String
    var band: String
}
```

#### Builder

- The protocol that declares the options for constructing the product.

- Associated types are used here so that each concrete builder can define its own enum types for size, material, and band.

- Compare the `Series10Builder` and `HèrmesSeries10Builder` enum types to see this in action.

- The protocol makes use of a fluent interface, allowing for the chaining of builder methods.

```swift
protocol AppleWatchBuilder {
    associatedtype SizeType
    associatedtype MaterialType
    associatedtype BandType

    func setSize(_ size: SizeType) -> Self
    func setMaterial(_ material: MaterialType) -> Self
    func setBand(_ band: BandType) -> Self
    func build() -> AppleWatch
}
```

#### Concrete Builders

- Conforms to the builder protocol and provides an implementation for building the product.

- Two concrete builders are defined here: `Series10Builder` and `HèrmesSeries10Builder`.

- Each one is tailored to a specific collection of Apple Watch.

- Type aliases are used here to pair the associated types for each concrete builder's enum type implementation.

```swift
class Series10Builder: AppleWatchBuilder {
    private var appleWatch = AppleWatch(
        collection: "Series 10",
        size: Size.fortyTwo.rawValue,
        material: Material.aluminum.rawValue,
        band: Band.sportBand.rawValue
    )

    enum Size: String {
        case fortyTwo = "42mm"
        case fortySix = "46mm"
    }

    enum Material: String {
        case aluminum = "Aluminum"
        case titanium = "Titanium"
    }

    enum Band: String {
        case sportBand = "Sport Band"
        case milaneseLoop = "Milanese Loop"
    }

    typealias SizeType = Size
    typealias MaterialType = Material
    typealias BandType = Band

    func setSize(_ size: Size) -> Self {
        appleWatch.size = size.rawValue
        return self
    }

    func setMaterial(_ material: Material) -> Self {
        appleWatch.material = material.rawValue
        return self
    }

    func setBand(_ band: Band) -> Self {
        appleWatch.band = band.rawValue
        return self
    }

    func build() -> AppleWatch {
        return appleWatch
    }
}

class HèrmesSeries10Builder: AppleWatchBuilder {
    private var appleWatch = AppleWatch(
        collection: "Hèrmes Series 10",
        size: Size.fortyTwo.rawValue,
        material: Material.titanium.rawValue,
        band: Band.torsade.rawValue
    )

    enum Size: String {
        case fortyTwo = "42mm"
        case fortySix = "46mm"
    }

    enum Material: String {
        case titanium = "Titanium"
    }

    enum Band: String {
        case torsade = "Torsade Single Tour"
        case grand = "Grand H"
    }

    typealias SizeType = Size
    typealias MaterialType = Material
    typealias BandType = Band

    func setSize(_ size: Size) -> Self {
        appleWatch.size = size.rawValue
        return self
    }

    func setMaterial(_ material: Material) -> Self {
        appleWatch.material = material.rawValue
        return self
    }

    func setBand(_ band: Band) -> Self {
        appleWatch.band = band.rawValue
        return self
    }

    func build() -> AppleWatch {
        return appleWatch
    }
}
```

## Example

```swift
let series10 = Series10Builder()

print(series10.build()) // Default Series 10 Apple Watch
// Output: AppleWatch(collection: "Series 10", size: "42mm", material: "Aluminum", band: "Sport Band")

series10.setSize(.fortySix).setMaterial(.titanium).setBand(.milaneseLoop) // Update Series 10 Apple Watch
print(series10.build())
// Output: AppleWatch(collection: "Series 10", size: "46mm", material: "Titanium", band: "Milanese Loop")

let hermesSeries10 = HèrmesSeries10Builder()

print(hermesSeries10.build()) // Default Hèrmes Series 10 Apple Watch
// Output: AppleWatch(collection: "Hèrmes Series 10", size: "42mm", material: "Titanium", band: "Torsade Single Tour")

hermesSeries10.setSize(.fortySix).setMaterial(.titanium).setBand(.grand) // Update Hèrmes Series 10 Apple Watch
print(hermesSeries10.build())
// Output: AppleWatch(collection: "Hèrmes Series 10", size: "46mm", material: "Titanium", band: "Grand H")
```
